This repository contains a simple terminal racing game written in Python.

## How to play

Run the script using Python:

```
python3 race.py
```

On each turn you will see the road. Type `a` to move left, `d` to move right,
or `q` to quit. Avoid the `X` obstacles and keep your car (`A`) alive as long
as possible.
